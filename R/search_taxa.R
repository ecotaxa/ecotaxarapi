#' Search Taxa
#'
#' **Search for taxa by name.** Queries can be 'small', i.e. of length ï¹¤3 and even zero-length. ðŸ”“ For a public, unauthenticated call : - zero-length and small queries always return nothing. - otherwise, a full search is done and results are returned in alphabetical order. ðŸ”’ For an authenticated call : - zero-length queries: return the MRU list in full. - small queries: the MRU list is searched, so that taxa in the recent list are returned, if matching. - otherwise, a full search is done. Results are ordered so that taxa in the project list are in first, and are signalled as such in the response.
#'
#' @param query string; Use this query for matching returned taxa names.
#' @param project_id integer; Internal, numeric id of the project.
